The modules and their respective functionailities are as follows:

SVD.py
function: eigen_decomp
          parameters: multiplied matrix (either A*A.T or A.T*A)
          returns: the eigen values and the eigen vectors
function: svd
          parameters: utility matrix.
          returns: the three matrices U, Sigma and Vtranspose

error_measures.py
function: rmse
          parameters: predicted matrix and the actual matrix
          returns: the root mean squared error between the two matrices calculated elementwise
function: mae
          parameters: predicted matrix and the actual matrix
          returns: the mean absolute error between the two matrices calculated elementwise
